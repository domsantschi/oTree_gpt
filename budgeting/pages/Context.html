            In the main part of the study, you will receive access to a scenario containing information about

        <p class="card-text">
            You will be asked to put yourself in the position of a <b>decision maker of Carlton County</b>. 
            You will then be asked to evaluate the available information and define the current year's budget.

            <b>Your Goal:</b> Set a budget for the current year that will be as close to the actual expenses as possible.

        <p class="card-text">
            You will have to explain your budget to the citizens of Carlton County at the upcoming 
            <b>New Year's Reception</b>. The New Year's Reception is a celebratory event 
            in Carlton County to welcome the new year and inform the citizens about the financial 
            outcomes of the past year and the new budget.
        </p>
        
        <p class="card-text">
            Be mindful that presenting the county's finances may be <b>easier when actual expenses 
            are lower than budgeted</b>. This is because citizens could appreciate the efficient 
            use of their taxpayer money.

        <h5 class="card-title">About Safety Buffers</h5>
        
        <p class="card-text">
            Hence, it may be a good idea to include a <b>safety buffer</b> in your budget.
        </p>
        
        <p class="card-text">
            A safety buffer provides additional flexibility to your county's finances. 
            See it as a <b>reserve you build into your budget</b> to cover unexpected expenses.
        </p>
        
        <p class="card-text">
            <b>Trade-off:</b> However, a safety buffer can also negatively impact the funds 
            available for other projects (e.g., building a new public school). You will need to balance 
            these considerations when setting your budget.
