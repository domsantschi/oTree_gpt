<h5>How Your Performance is Measured</h5>
<p>
    In each round, a <strong>specialized civil servant</strong> provides a <strong>forecast</strong> (best estimate) for the budget account being negotiated.
    Your goal is to negotiate budget amounts with the other participant that are as close to these expert forecasts as possible.
</p>

<h6 class="mt-4">The Negotiation Process</h6>
<ol>
    <li>You will see the specialized civil servant's <strong>forecast</strong> for each budget account</li>
    <li>Using a slider, you can adjust your proposal above or below the forecast</li>
    <li>You and your partner compare proposals and agree on the lower budget</li>
    <li>If you disagree, you can resubmit new proposals</li>
</ol>

<h6 class="mt-4">Performance Measurement</h6>
<p>Your performance is measured in two ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Rounds Completed:</strong> Complete as many budget negotiation rounds as possible within the 5-minute time limit</li>
    <li><strong>Deviation from Forecasts:</strong> The closer your agreed amounts are to the civil servant's forecasts, the better your performance</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-info mt-4">
    <strong>Example:</strong> If the civil servant forecasts CHF 250,000 for Education and you agree on CHF 240,000, 
    your deviation for that round is CHF 10,000. The lower your deviation from the specialized civil servant's forecast, the better your performance.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning mt-4">
    <strong>Remember:</strong> The specialized civil servant's forecast represents the expert's best estimate based on detailed analysis. 
    Deviating too far from the forecast may indicate suboptimal budget allocation.
