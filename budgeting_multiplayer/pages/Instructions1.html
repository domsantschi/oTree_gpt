    Each round focuses on negotiating the budget allocation for a specific account (either an expense or revenue category).
    You will see historical data and work with your partner to agree on an appropriate budget amount.
</p>

<p>
    The game continues for <strong>5 minutes</strong>, during which you can complete as many negotiation rounds as possible.
</p>
<p>
    After each round, you will receive feedback on your performance, including how close your agreed amount was to the target and your score for that round.
