<h4>Welcome to this study!</h4>

<p>
    In this study, you will be paired with another participant. Together, you will play
    a series of decision-making rounds.
</p>

<h5 class="mt-4">How it works</h5>
<p>
    In each round, both you and your partner will simultaneously choose between two actions:
    <strong>Action 1</strong> or <strong>Action 2</strong>. Your payoff depends on both your 
    choice and your partner's choice.
</p>

<h5 class="mt-4">Payoff Structure</h5>
<table class='table table-bordered text-center' style='width: auto; margin: auto'>
    <tr>
        <th colspan=2 rowspan=2></th>
        <th colspan=2>The Other Participant</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Action 1</th>
        <th>Action 2</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th rowspan=2>You</th>
        <th>Action 1</th>
        <td>{{ C.BOTH_COOPERATE_PAYOFF }}, {{ C.BOTH_COOPERATE_PAYOFF }}</td>
        <td>{{ C.BETRAYED_PAYOFF }}, {{ C.BETRAY_PAYOFF }}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Action 2</th>
        <td>{{ C.BETRAY_PAYOFF }}, {{ C.BETRAYED_PAYOFF }}</td>
        <td>{{ C.BOTH_DEFECT_PAYOFF }}, {{ C.BOTH_DEFECT_PAYOFF }}</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p class="small text-muted text-center mt-2">
    (Your payoff is listed first, your partner's payoff is listed second)
</p>

<h5 class="mt-4">Game Duration</h5>
<p>
    After each round, there is a <strong>90% chance</strong> 
    that the game continues to another round, and a <strong>10% chance</strong> that the game ends.
</p>
<p>
    This means you do not know in advance how many rounds you will play. Each round's continuation 
    is determined independently by a random draw.
</p>

<h5 class="mt-4">Your Goal</h5>
<p>
    Your goal is to accumulate as many points as possible across all rounds. At the end, you will
    be asked to complete a short questionnaire about your experience.
