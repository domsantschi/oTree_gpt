        You are now allowed to proceed with the study. Your performance will be evaluated as described below:
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Base Compensation:</b> USD 3.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Bonus Opportunity:</b> You can earn an additional bonus of up to USD 2. The bonus is determined by two factors:
    </p>
    
    {% if condition == 'Cost Impact Focus' %}
    <ol>
        <p>
        <li>
            <b>The Deviance (i.e., the Static-Budget Variance*) between the Actual Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and your Budget:</b> 
            Your virtual colleagues have all the information to get the Deviance down to zero. The lower the deviance, the higher your bonus.
        </li>
        </p>
        <li>
            <b>Your Engagement with Virtual Colleagues:</b> 
            While engaging with your virtual colleagues can help reduce uncertainty, more engagement reduces your bonus.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        * Static-Budget Variance = Actual Results - Budgeted Results
    </p>
    {% elif condition == 'Environmental Impact Focus' %}
    <ol>
        <p>
        <li>
            <b>The Deviance (i.e., the Static-Budget Variance*) between the Actual CO2 Emissions and your Budget:</b> 
            Your virtual colleagues have all the information to get the Deviance down to zero. The lower the deviance, the higher your bonus.
        </li>
        </p>
        <li>
            <b>Your Engagement with Virtual Colleagues:</b> 
            While engaging with your virtual colleagues can help reduce uncertainty, more engagement reduces your bonus.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        * Static-Budget Variance = Actual Results - Budgeted Results
