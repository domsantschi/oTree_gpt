        You are now allowed to proceed with the study. Your manager will evaluate your performance and determine your compensation based on two factors:
    </p>
    {% if condition == 'Cost Impact Focus' %}
        <ul>
            <li><b>The Actual Costs of Goods Sold</b> for the Year Ending December 31, 2025. The lower the actual costs, the better. </li>
            <li><b>The Deviance between the Actual Costs</b> of Goods Sold <b>and the Budgeted</b> Costs of Goods Sold for the Year Ending December 31, 2025. The lower the deviance, the better.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Both factors are equally weighted for your performance evaluation (both at 50%). 
        </p>
    {% elif condition == 'Environmental Impact Focus' %}
    <ul>
        <li><b>The Actual CO2 Emissions</b> of the Costs of Goods Sold for the Year Ending December 31, 2025. The lower the actual CO2 emissions, the better. </li>
        <li><b>The Deviance between the Actual CO2 Emissions </b> of the Costs of Goods Sold <b>and the Budgeted</b> CO2 Emissions of the Costs of Goods Sold for the Year Ending December 31, 2025. The lower the deviance, the better..</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Both factors are equally weighted for your performance evaluation (both at 50%). 
    </p>
