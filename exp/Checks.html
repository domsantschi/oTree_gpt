 1. What are the <b>two factors</b> that will be used for your <b>performance evaluation</b> and the determination of your compensation?
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <input type="radio" name="impact_focus" value="costs" required>

    <li>
        <input type="radio" name="impact_focus" value="co2" required>
        The <b>Actual CO2 Emissions</b> of the Costs of Goods Sold and <b>the Deviance between the Actual CO2 Emissions</b> of the Costs of Goods Sold and the <b>Budgeted CO2 Emissions</b> of the Costs of Goods Sold

2. When interacting with your virtual colleagues, were you aware that <b>each query reduces your compensation</b> and that each query you ask will cause <b>real-life CO2 emissions</b>?
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <input type="radio" name="impact_transparency" value="costs" required>
        No, <b>I was not aware</b> that each query would incur a cost that would reduce my payoff and that each query I ask will cause real-life CO2 emissions.
    </li>
    <li>
        <input type="radio" name="impact_transparency" value="co2" required>
        Yes, <b>I was aware</b> that each query would incur a cost that would reduce my payoff and that each query I ask will cause real-life CO2 emissions.
