<h5>How Long Will the Game Last?</h5>
<p>
    The number of rounds is <strong>not predetermined</strong>. Instead, after each round:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>There is a <strong>90% chance</strong> the game continues to another round</li>
    <li>There is a <strong>10% chance</strong> the game ends</li>
</ul>

    Each round's continuation is determined <strong>independently</strong> by a random draw.
    This means you cannot predict exactly how many rounds you will play.
